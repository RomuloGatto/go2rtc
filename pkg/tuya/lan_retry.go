// handshake, the offer and the ICE negotiation all still complete - the camera just never sends
// media - so the failure looks like a healthy session that stays empty.
//
// go2rtc restarts a producer as soon as a consumer asks again, and a producer whose Start()
// fails is retried immediately (its retry counter restarts at zero), so an ungraceful retry loop
// keeps the camera saturated with half sessions and the `tuya-lan` source stays dead until the
// process is restarted. Spacing failed attempts out lets the camera's session table drain.
